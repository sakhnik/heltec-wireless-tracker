# heltec-wireless-tracker

I purchased [Heltec Wireless Tracker](https://heltec.org/project/wireless-tracker/)
to build personal tracking solution. Just when I figured out how to utilize the on-board
peripherals like TFT screen, GNSS receiver and LoRa radio, I realized that all I need
[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) already provides all the required functionality.

I just need to build the case for the board and the battery.
